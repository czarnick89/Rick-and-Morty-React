        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>Rick and Morty is an adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon. It debuted on Adult Swim in December 2013. The show follows the adventures of cynical, alcoholic scientist Rick Sanchez and his good-hearted but easily influenced grandson Morty Smith as they travel across dimensions and encounter bizarre, often darkly humorous situations.</p>
        <h2>Initial Reception:</h2>
        <p>Upon release, Rick and Morty was widely praised for its originality, dark humor, clever writing, and deep philosophical undertones. It quickly developed a strong cult following and became one of Adult Swim’s most successful shows. The show was lauded for balancing absurd sci-fi with emotional storytelling, and it gained a reputation for intelligent, subversive humor.</p>
        <h2>Controversy and Creator Accusations:</h2>
        <p>In early 2023, co-creator Justin Roiland was charged with felony domestic violence related to an alleged 2020 incident. Although the charges were later dropped due to insufficient evidence, the allegations had a significant impact. Adult Swim cut ties with Roiland shortly after the charges were made public, announcing that he would no longer be involved in the show as a voice actor or executive producer.</p>
        <h2>Aftermath and Reception Post-Allegations:</h2>
        <p>Following Roiland’s departure, Adult Swim continued production of Rick and Morty without him, recasting the voices of both Rick and Morty. The seventh season, released in late 2023, marked the first without his involvement. Fans and critics were divided—some supported the show’s continuation and praised the replacements, while others felt the series had lost a vital part of its original magic. Overall, while the show retained a loyal fanbase, its cultural prominence and critical reception saw some decline after the controversy.</p>
